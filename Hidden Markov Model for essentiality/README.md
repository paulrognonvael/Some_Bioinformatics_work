Replicate of the work done by DeJesus et Iorger in [1]. They propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for identifying essential regions in bacterial genome from sequencing data obtained by
transposon insertion. They evaluate the performance of the model on a sequence dataset of the H37Rv strain of M.Tuberculosis (Mtb) transposon mutants constructed by Griffin et al. [2]
