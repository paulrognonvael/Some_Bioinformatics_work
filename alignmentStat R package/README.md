The package is a wrapper for alignmentStat function. That function uses shuffling to produce a range of statistics and graphical outputs that help assess the statistical signficance of the alignment score of two protein or DNA sequences. The sequences are read from FASTA files. One of the sequences is iteratively shuffled and scored against the other sequence to obtain a sample distribution of scores. The function estimates empirical p-value and e-value out of the obtained distibution. A Gumbel distribution is fitted on the sample and used to provide standardized Gumbel score and p-value.
